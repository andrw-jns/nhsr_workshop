# NHS-R Workshop

## 1. Repository for workshop materials



## 2. EDA: Real-life data | Identify the mystery disease "x"

### Instructions

1. Download the files as a zip. Extract them (into your project directory) and import them into R.

1. Examine the individual datasets. Can we join them together? It may be easier to group the cases data set by district first. Hint: use summarise(x_related_deaths = n())

1. Examine the compiled data frame. Look at the column names and the observations: 

Can we make a guess at what "x" is?

4. We will come back together to share ideas. If you finish early, or need more clues create some descriptive plots of key variables. geom_point, geom_boxplot, and geom_jitter may be useful
