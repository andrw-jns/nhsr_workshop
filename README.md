### EDA Instructions | A real data set | Find the mystery disease "x"

1. Download the files as a zip. Extract them and import them into R.

1. Examine the individual datasets. Can we join them together? It may be easier to group the cases by district first. Hint: use summarise(x_related_deaths = n())

1. Examine the compiled data frame. Look at the column names and the observations. 

Can we make a guess at what "x" is?

4. We will come back together to share ideas. If you finish early, you can get a headstart on the next task by creating some descriptive plots of the key variables. geom_point, geom_boxplot, and geom_jitter may be useful
